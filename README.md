# ionic-starter-requirejs

This is an addon starter template with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

## How to use this template

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project.

## Explanation

With RequireJS you can simply split your projects js-files in as many parts you want.
Additionally you can use the packaging tool [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) to build own releases (uglified, minified and packaged in one file).

For a simple way to use you can install grund-cli and use [grunt-contrib-requirejs](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-requirejs)
